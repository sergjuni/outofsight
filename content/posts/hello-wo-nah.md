so here we are, or i am, i dont know

i guess there isnt much to say at the time, i had, some months ago, an insight **I WANT TO MAKE A GAME**, so i started learning godot which led me to learn blender which led to me being extremely frustrated because i tried to jump some learning steps about 3d modeling and oh boy, did i have fucked shit up

but it is what it is, i guess writing here will help me keep track about my ideas about this whole **make a game** thing and see how the ideas evolve with time, thats seems cool enough to make this whole personal/tech blog thing.

this will not be a personal diary or something like that, for sure, for that i have twitter and it is enough for now, this will be much more like brainstorming/geeking the fuck out about my ideas for this project.

so here we go again, to blender > import the blender shit in godot and seeing working, if i can get that i can get anything, so far i have a poc about the camera angles (old RE style) and a bunch of cool ideas that i dont know if i can pull off, but i will die trying, at least its a fun process.
